# Image Compression Script

This Python script compresses images using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It takes an input image path, an optional output path, and a compression quality percentage, then saves the compressed image to the specified location.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow library

Install the Pillow library using:
```sh
pip install pillow
```
## Usage
- Run the script.
- Provide the input path of the image you want to compress.
- Optionally, provide an output path. If not provided, the compressed image will be saved in the same directory as the input image with a prefix compressed_image_.
- Optionally, provide a compression percentage. If not provided, the default compression percentage is 15%.
